This code represents a Flask web application that generates a webpage displaying earthquake data using various visualizations (charts) and information sections. The application uses Chart.js for creating the charts and renders an HTML template with Flask's render_template_string method.

Let's break down the code into sections:

Imports and Setup:

The code begins with necessary imports (Flask, render_template_string, and pandas) and sets up a Flask application instance.
Earthquake Data:

Sample earthquake data is defined in a list of dictionaries (earthquake_data) containing information like date, time, magnitude, depth, and epicenter.
Locations Affected by the Earthquake:

Three lists (jaipur_locations, surrounding_locations, near_jaipur_locations) contain names of locations affected by the earthquake.
Creating Pandas DataFrame:

The earthquake data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame (df), making it easier to manipulate and use within the Flask application.
Flask Routes:

The / route is defined with the index() function, which renders an HTML template using render_template_string.
HTML Template:

The HTML template contains multiple sections:
Header Section: Displays basic information and social media links.
Chart Sections: Renders Bar, Line, and Pie charts using Chart.js, visualizing earthquake magnitude, depth, and distribution in different locations.
Affected Areas Section: Lists the affected areas based on the predefined locations.
Earthquake Impact Information Section: Shows a table of earthquake information and details about the impact.
Footer Section: Includes contact information and social media links.
Chart.js Script:

JavaScript code within the HTML template initializes Chart.js and configures data for the charts (magnitude, depth, distribution).
Header Visibility Toggle:

Additional JavaScript is included to handle header visibility on scroll. It toggles the header's visibility based on the scroll direction.
Flask App Execution:

The script checks if the current file is being run directly and starts the Flask app in debug mode if so.
Overall, this code integrates Flask, Pandas, Chart.js, and HTML/CSS to create a web application that presents earthquake data through various visualizations and informational sections, providing a comprehensive overview of the earthquake's impact.
